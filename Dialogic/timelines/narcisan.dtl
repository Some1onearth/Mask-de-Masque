if {CurrentMask} == "wild":
	Finally, someone who’s ugly here.
	Oh. Don’t get upset.
	I mostly didn’t mean it.
	If someone painted us, I bet we’d both look good.
	You’ve probably never had yourself painted.
	I’ve got like 10 portraits of myself at home.
	You can have one of mine and pretend it’s your mirror if you like.
elif {CurrentMask} == "peasant":
	Leave me alone.
	I’m currently thinking of what pose I should make when the King comes out.
elif {CurrentMask} == "eunuch":
	Do you have any skills in painting?
	I need someone to capture my reaction when the King shows himself.
	It would sell for a lot, I’m sure!
elif {CurrentMask} == "noble":
	Do you have a personal painter?
	They say that the more portraits of you in your home reveals how important you are.
	Or was it unimportant?

	BALD! BALD! MY EYES!!!!
